This repo is deprecated! Use [KinoFog][Kino]!
---------------------------------------------

This repository had been used for experimental purposes, and its fade-to-skybox
functionality has been merged to [KinoFog][Kino]. I've stopped updating this
repository, and thus it's recommended to use KinoFog instead of this when you
need its functionality.

FedeToSkybox - Description
--------------------------

A variant of the global fog shader, which fades to a skybox instead of a constant color.
